The 'Loop from the City to Denver where the North American Launch Gun was located took
only about 3 hours as usual.
He liked the ride out of the city because the tubes where clear once you made it past New Jersey.
Despite the heat, you could still stare off into the distance of the purple-tinged mountain tips,
and admire the beautiful, young forests the reclaimers try to plant to reverse the effects humanity
had on the tortured planet, even though those same forests would be dead in 4 months from the noxious
atmosphere.

You could see the launch gun from many miles away as it was unmistakeable: a 100km long
tube suspended in air by high integrity weather ballons and very powerful electromagnets.
It took over five nuclear powerplants to power the magnets and charge the launch capacitors,
but the results were a breathtaking couple minutes of pure, terrifying acceleration through the clouds.
By the time the launch capsule escaped the tube, it would be flying faster than a bullet through
the nearly absent atmosphere above the edge of space.
The salvage bots had a heck of time keeping the exits of the various launch guns clear of orbital debris,
but at least a couple times a week the orbits were clear enough to launch capsules to the Outpost.
